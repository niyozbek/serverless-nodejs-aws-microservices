Ever felt like you would like to build a back-end application that can handle millions of users, but you were terrified by the idea of managing (or learning how to manage) the infrastructure behind it?

Ever felt like you would like to focus on delivering valuable features, rather than making sure your services are up and running?

Ever felt like you are paying more than you should be?

Good news!

Serverless Architecture takes the pain of site reliability off your shoulders. With Serverless Architecture, you and your team can focus on feature development. Your application will scale effortlessly, serving users reliably. You do not need to be an infrastructure expert to serve an application at scale. With Serverless, you only pay for what you use.

Serverless Framework revolutionizes the way we develop Serverless applications, by providing a developer-friendly API that supports dozens of cloud providers including Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, and more.

More than that, Serverless Framework intelligently helps you manage your infrastructure as code (IaC), which eliminates the chance of paying for services that are not in use.

With an active community and a rich ecosystem of plugins, you can get things done at lightspeed and without boilerplate code.

Serverless Framework is language-agnostic, which means you can use the language and runtime of your choice (Node.js, Ruby, Python, Go, C#, Java, etc).
